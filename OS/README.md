# Operating systems
- This folder contains basic OS concepts and implemention of basic concepts like processes, threads, synchronization and memory management.
- implementation based on C programming and linux os

## Topics
- Review C : implementing the [doubly linkedlist](https://github.com/HUMANIAM/OS_DB_NW/blob/master/OS/review_c/linked_list.c) you can refresh your knowledge of C (pointers, structs, dynamic allocation). adding some good functions to linkedlist such as search, delete, push_back, push_forward, reverse
- Matrix Multiplication Using Pthreads
- Shell Programming
- OS Concepts : 
	- what is OS?, Kernel, MicorKernel, Execution modes, services provided by the OS
	- Processes, Process lifecycle, PCB, page table, process address space, process creation, interprocess communication.
	- simple shell execute uniary commands, pipe line commands, redirection commands (as simple app on processes)
	- threads synchronization using condition variable and mutex execulsion, read/write threads on critical section (as simple app)
