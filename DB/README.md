## Topics
- Introduction to database
- XML structure, XML validatoin Using DTD and XSL
- Json structure, Json validation
- Relational algebra : select, project, Join, set operators, renaming, Notation, diff, intersect, divsion, union
- SQL Queries : select, set operators, join types, closure, subqueries, aggregation, group by, modification, DDL, DML
- XPATH, XQUERY : quering xml document to extract specific data
- XSLT : xslt used to transform xml document to another document it can be also xml with new data or html or xml file
- UML Data Model : It is a graphical language used to design database in a higher level then we convert this uml design into relations for RDBMS.
- Relational Design theory: Design anomalies, Functional dependencies, multivalued dependencies, Normal Form(BNCF, 4th NF)
- Indexes & Transcations : using indexes to speed up DB processing, using transcations to handle problem results from system failures and inconsistency resulted from concurrency in DB.
- Constraints & triggers: constraints, referential integrity, handling referential integrity violation, row_level triggers and statement_level triggers
- Views&Authorization : virtual views, materialized views, automatic views modification, user creator modification of views, authorization using views, granting and invoking priviledges of DB users
- Online Analytical Processing : OLAP, OLAT, star schema, dimension tables, fact tables, Cube, Dicing, Slicing, rollup, drillDown, 
- SQL Recursion : writting recursion queries in sql.
